# AI-Based-Pathfinding-Visualizer
📌 Overview
An interactive Python application that visualizes pathfinding algorithms on a customizable grid. Watch how different algorithms like A Search, BFS, DFS, Best-First Search, and Hill Climbing* navigate through obstacles in real-time.

✨ Features
Interactive grid (place start/end points and obstacles)

5 search algorithms with real-time visualization

Custom grid sizes (adjustable rows/columns)

Random obstacle generation

Clean GUI built with Tkinter

🛠️ Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/piyush-jaloniya/AI-Based-Pathfinding-Visualizer.git  


Navigate to the project directory:


cd pathfinding-visualizer  


Run the application:


python main.py  


🎮 How to Use

Set Start/End Points: Click cells to place the start (green) and end (red) points

Add Obstacles: Click to toggle walls (black)

Select an Algorithm: Choose from the dropdown menu

Run: Click "Run" to visualize the pathfinding

Customize: Use buttons to randomize obstacles or resize the grid
